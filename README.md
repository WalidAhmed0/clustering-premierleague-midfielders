# Midfielder Clustering and Similarity Network Analysis
Analysis to identify 24/25 PL midfield archetypes using K-Means clustering and visualising player similarities through a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

### Data Source
Data was collected from [FBref.com](https://fbref.com/).

### Files
- `midfielder.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and visualisations.
- `24_25midfielder.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

### Analysis Methods
- Hierarchical clustering (for determining optimal cluster numbers)
- K-Means clustering
- MST visualisation with NetworkX and Matplotlib
